# AusWeatherDecisionTree 🌦️🌳  

A machine learning project that uses a **Decision Tree** model to predict **whether it will rain tomorrow** based on historical weather data in Australia.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The project uses the **"weatherAUS.csv"** dataset, which contains daily weather observations from various locations in Australia.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Decision Tree Model for Rain Prediction  
✅ Data Visualization with Seaborn & Plotly  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AusWeatherDecisionTree.git
   cd AusWeatherDecisionTree
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.  

## 📊 Results  
The decision tree model predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on past weather conditions.  

## 🤝 Contributing  
Feel free to contribute by improving model accuracy, adding feature engineering, or optimizing the decision tree.
